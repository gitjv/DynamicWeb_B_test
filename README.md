# DynamicWeb_B_test
Demo tree and zip for modified version of the Gramps DynamicWeb report

_Dynamic Web Report B_ is an enhancement of the original Gramps Dynamic Web Report

The document __Dynamic Web Report B.pdf__ describes what it does. In short it has:

**Timeline Events**
* The event tab for a person is a timeline with their own events, plus vital events (births and deaths) of their siblings, parents, children and spouses. Tickboxes let you filter out various events.

**Tracking**
* One or more people in your tree can be tagged, and then the relationship of each person in the report is tracked back to these people, eg whether they are a great aunt, or cousin etc. This shows in the person header.

**Why Me** and **Story**
* Someone is in your tree for a reason. the Why Me box explains why. It is filled from a note attached to that person. It shows in the person's page header.
* Every person can have a Story note attached to them, which shows in the person's header.

**Multiple Family clarity**
* I could not see when looking at the Ancestors and Descendants tabs how multiple families were relevant to a person. There is now a bit more data exposed to help with that.

**Local labels**
* Change a label on the report, just from the contents of a note. For example, change ‘Ancestors’ to ‘Parents and Siblings’. 
* I think this works with other languages (I have briefly tested with French).

There are some other changes as well, described in the attached pdf.

The zip file can be downloaded, then extracted and dropped into your plugins folder.
