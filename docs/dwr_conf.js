EXTENDED_EVENTS_NOTE="<!-- timeline events note for Dynamic Web B report-->\n<h4>Extended Events</h4>\nThis table lists the following events for a person:<br>\n<ul><li>their individual events such as residence, occupation, census, news, military service... </li>\n<li>vital events (birth and death) for their family:</li>\n<ul><li>themselves</li> \n<li>their children</li>\n<li>their spouses</li>\n<li>their siblings</li>\n<li>their parents</li></ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Events are sorted by date. If no event is recorded for a family member it can\'t be shown.  This means for example that a parent without a birth won\'t show as a \'birth of parent\' event</p>\n<p> If an event does not have a date, it is sorted at the top of the table. Undated events won\'t show in \'limit to lifespan\'.</p>\n<p>Siblings includes full brothers and sisters (both birth parents the same), half-brothers and half-sisters (children with one common birth parent), and others. \nOthers includes siblings who are step, adopted, sponsored and so on.  The family details will tell you more. </p>\n<p>You can turn off the display of notes - it gives a better list view if there are a lot of vitals to show. The notes in an event row are notes about that event (eg if the event is a birth of parent, the note is about the parent).</p>\n<p>\'Other\' participants are other than the person already named in \'who\' and the person whose page it is.  For \'birth of child\' events it includes the other birth parent.<p>\n<p> Note for a \'birth of parent\' the \'who\' is the parent, so participants includes the birth parents of that parent.<p>\n<p>Checkbox ticks remain as ticked when you open a new person page.</p>\n<p>Events without a date won\'t show in \'limit to lifespan\'.</p>\n";
